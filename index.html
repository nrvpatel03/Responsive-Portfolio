            My name is Nirav Patel and I live in Buena Park, California. I graduated from the University of Illinois with a Bachelor's degree. 
            After graduating, I taught myself how to program in Java and how to use Android Studio. 
            After a few months, I was able to release an app on the Google Play Store. 
            By doing this, I became more passionate about development. 
            Computers have always been fascinating to me because of how much we can do with them. 
            We can create web sites that people can see or applications that people can use. 
            Creating my game application made me more passionate about software development, 
            web development and mobile development. 
            I am passionate about computers, so much so I even developed this website using HTML and CSS!
